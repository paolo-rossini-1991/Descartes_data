# Metadata of 333 letters mentioning Descartes (1629-1650)

Research data for article: Paolo Rossini, "The Networked Origins of Cartesian Philosophy and Science," HOPOS: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science, Volume 12, Issue 1, Pages 97-120 (2022).

Metadata includes the date of the letters and information about their senders and recipients. If the date is not certain, it is given as an interval (date start-date end).

Note Descartes's correspondence is not included in the data set. 

The metadata was harvested from two online repositories, ePistolarium and EMLO. A special thanks goes to the editors of Marin Mersenne's correspondence catalogue for agreeing to share their data with me.
